# Director

Being a good director is not just about leadership, it's about fostering
participation and creativity in others. Whether I'm providing the technical
insight for an organizational initiative, projecting strategies and deadlines,
starting our team on a project iteration, or just giving advice, I approach
the challenge with empathy, imagination, and fortitude—and without buzzwords
whenever possible.

# Engineer

Problem solving is my passion and software is my favorite Swiss army hammer.
What began as childhood curiosity has evolved into a 12-year professional
career of building large-scale web applications, custom frameworks, data
pipelines, and APIs. I love working in agile teams because there is great
power in collaboration and I prefer open source because
`{ innovation.should > capital }`

# Systems

In the good old days I racked routers, configured subnets, and built
RAID-backed database behemoths. Over the past 5 years—the better days—I have
been managing a medium-sized and heavily scaled infrastructure on AWS, using
tools like Puppet and my very own [Aether][1] shell.
